CYCLE 24 TOOK 64 MONTHS TO REACH SOLAR MAXIMUM LONGER THAN ANY CYCLE SINCE 1945. THE SUN RECENTLY PRODUCED MORE SPOTLESS DAYS THAN USUAL DURING THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH MONTHS AFTER SOLAR MINIMUM.  THE SUNSPOT INDEX AND LONG TERM SOLAR OBSERVATIONS SILSO WORLD DATA CENTER AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY OF BELGIUM ANTICIPATES UP TO 1,024 SPOTLESS DAYS BEFORE THE TRANSITION TO CYCLE 25 COMPLETES, LIKELY BEFORE THE END OF 2021.  A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CYCLE 25 CYCLE 25 PRODUCED 180 SPOTLESS DAYS AND SOME OCCASIONAL WEAK SUNSPOTS THROUGH OCTOBER 2020.  THE WEAK SUNSPOTS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON HF DX PROPAGATION, AS EVIDENCED BY THE 10R7 CENTIMETER \", \"220726_30.txt\": \"REQUIREMENTS, BOURQUE SAID.  THE PREFERRED METHOD OF SUBMITTING ENTRIES AFTER FIELD DAY IS VIA THE WEB APPLET.

INNOVATOR ULRICH ROHDE, N1UL, DONATES SOPHISTICATED VECTOR SIGNAL GENERATOR TO ARRL ARRL LIFE MEMBER ULRICH ROHDE, N1UL, HAS DONATED A ROHDE SCHWARZ SMBV100A VECTOR SIGNAL GENERATOR TO THE ARRL LABORATORY.  THE DEVICE OFFERS INTERNAL SIGNAL GENERATION FOR ALL MAJOR DIGITAL RADIO STANDARDS.  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS NEWS AND EXTREMELY GENEROUS, ARRL CEO DAVID MINSTER, NA2AA, TOLD ROHDE.  ARRL LABORATORY MANAGER ED HARE, W1RFI, SAID THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE A VALUABLE ADDITION TO THE LABS TESTING CAPABILITIES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO MORE COMPREHENSIVE TESTS ON MODERN RADIOS, ALMOST ALL OF WHICH USE SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO TECHNOLOGY, HARE SAID.  WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO ADD TESTING OF RECEIVERS DIGITAL CAPABILITY.  THE FLEXIBILITY OF THIS GENERATOR WILL SERVE THE LABORATORY FOR YEARS TO COME.

SHOULD THAT HAPPEN TO YOU, THE MANUAL HELPFULLY DESCRIBES THE STEPS NECESSARY TO RESET THE RADIO TO FACTORY DEFAULTS. SATISFIED WITH MY DEEPER DIVE INTO THE MANUAL, IT WAS TIME AGAIN TO APPLY POWER.  THE FTDX10S RELAYS SPRING TO LIFE AND THE TFT DISPLAY IS ALWAYS A MARVEL TO BEHOLD.  SELECTING THE 3DSS DISPLAY MODE, IM TREATED TO A MESMERIZING THREE DIMENSIONAL FIELD OF SIGNAL SPIKES SEE FIGURE 3.  YOU CAN SELECT A MORE TRADITIONAL WATERFALL DISPLAY, IF YOU PREFER, AND EVEN BRING UP INSET DISPLAYS FOR AUDIO AND MORE.  PICKING AT ONE MINOR NIT, SOME POPUP SCREENS, SUCH AS BAND SELECTION, DISAPPEAR IF YOU DONT MAKE A CHOICE WITHIN COUPLE OF SECONDS.  THE RADIO SOON TRAINED ME TO THINK FAST AND NOT CONTEMPLATE MY OPTIONS, BUT THIS WAS STILL AN ANNOYING BEHAVIOR.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF ALL SCREENS REMAINED VISIBLE UNTIL YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE, HOWEVER LONG THAT MIGHT TAKE.  A SMOOTH SPIN OF THE LARGE VFO KNOB SENT THE CURSOR RACING THOUGH THE DISPLAY.

IF YOU ATTACH THE USB CABLE BETWEEN THE IC R30 AND YOUR COMPUTER, YOUR COMPUTER WILL RECOGNIZE THE RADIOS MEMORY CARD AS IT WOULD ANY OTHER STORAGE DEVICE, SUCH AS A DISK DRIVE.  IN MY CASE, THE COMPUTER DECIDED THAT THE IC R30 WOULD BE DRIVE E. ALL I HAD TO DO WAS OPEN WINDOWS EXPLORER, AND I COULD ACCESS EVERYTHING ON THE CARD AND WRITE TO THE CARD AS WELL.  THATS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN PHYSICALLY SWAPPING CARDS AND ADAPTERS.  AS A BONUS, THE IC R30 BATTERY CAN RECHARGE THROUGH THE USB CONNECTION.  THE AMOUNT OF POWER AVAILABLE AT USB PORTS CAN VARY, SO SOME MAY BE BETTER CHARGERS THAN OTHERS.  I TRIED A FEW USB OPTIONS, AND WHILE THE BATTERY CHARGED IN ALL CASES, CHARGING SEEMED FASTER WITH THE DEDICATED ICOM CHARGER.  IN ADDITION TO AN AUTOMATIC RECEPTION LOG, ANYTHING YOU CAN HEAR CAN BE RECORDED AND STORED TO THE CARD FOR LATER PLAYBACK, EITHER THROUGH THE RADIO ITSELF OR YOUR COMPUTER.  THE IC R30 STORES AUDIO IN WAV FORMAT, WHICH CAN RESULT IN SOME LARGE FILES, BUT MY 8 GB MEMORY CARD HAD PLENTY OF ROOM.

THE INPUT TO THE AGC CIRCUIT CONNECTS TO THE TOP OF THE EXISTING RECEIVER VOLUME CONTROL, WHICH IS THE OUTPUT FROM THE AUDIO PREAMP.  POTENTIOMETER R8 SETS THE THRESHOLD POINT WHERE AGC ACTION BEGINS. THE SIGNAL IS AMPLIFIED BY Q1 AND RECTIFIED BY D1 AND D2.  THE RECTIFIED SIGNAL CHARGES C6.  THE DC VOLTAGE LEVEL STORED ON C6 VARIES WITH THE INCOMING AUDIO LEVEL.  IT IS THEN AMPLIFIED BY Q2 AND, IF DESIRED, OPTIONALLY DRIVES THE POSITIVE INPUT OF A 1 MA FULLSCALE S METER.  THE NEGATIVE S METER LEAD CONNECTS TO GROUND.  POTENTIOMETER R9 ADJUSTS THE LEVEL TO CALIBRATE THE METER.  THE AMPLIFIED SIGNAL ALSO PASSES TO Q3, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE RECEIVER BOARD AT R8 OF FIGURE 2.  AS SIGNAL LEVEL INCREASES, Q3 BEGINS TO TURN ON.  AS INPUT SIGNAL LEVEL INCREASES, THE AGC BOARD DRAWS MORE CURRENT.  LESS CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH D2 OF FIGURE 2 ON THE RECEIVER BOARD, SO GAIN DECREASES IN THE SECOND IF AMPLIFIER STAGE AND THAT, IN TURN, LESSENS THE DETECTED AUDIO LEVEL.
